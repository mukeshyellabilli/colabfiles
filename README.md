# Python Data Analysis Practice Files

Welcome to the Python Data Analysis Practice Files repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to help you learn and practice data analysis using various Python libraries.

## Overview

This repository is intended for beginners and intermediate learners who are looking to build their skills in data analysis using Python. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, from data cleaning and manipulation to visualization and machine learning.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Practice files in this section will help you learn how to clean and preprocess raw data using Python. You'll find examples of handling missing values, outlier detection, and data transformation.

2. **Data Manipulation**: Here, you'll explore how to manipulate and transform data using popular Python libraries such as Pandas. The files include examples of filtering, grouping, merging datasets, and more.

3. **Data Visualization**: Visualization is a key part of data analysis. This section includes practice files that demonstrate how to create various types of plots and graphs using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: This section includes scripts that show how to perform statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis, using Python's statistical libraries.

5. **Machine Learning**: Learn the basics of machine learning with Python. This section includes practice files that cover topics such as data splitting, model training, and evaluation using libraries like Scikit-Learn.

6. **Real-World Data Projects**: These are more comprehensive projects that combine all the skills you've learned. Each project uses a real-world dataset to perform a complete data analysis, from cleaning and visualization to modeling.
